          <p style="color: black; font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; margin-top: 20px;font-family: serif; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is the outcome of accumulated knowledge and application in all techniques, skills, methods, and procedures utilized in industrial production and scientific study that is always evolving. For the intended aim of an organization, technology is incorporated in the operation of all machines, with or without thorough understanding of their function. Systems are the building blocks of society's technologies. By collecting an input, adjusting this input for the system's intended purpose through a process, and then creating an outcome that changes the system's final intended purpose, systems apply the intended application of a technology's acquired knowledge. A technology system, or technical system, is another name for this.The creation of knowledge that leads to the application of fundamental tools toward a specific goal is the earliest and most basic kind of technology. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools and the understanding of how to regulate fire boosted the sources of food available to humans by removing practically all disease-causing microorganisms from food sources through correct cooking techniques. Through the development of farming technology, the Neolithic Revolution increased the relevance of this event and quadrupled the nourishment available from a usable land.With the invention of the internet, we now have access to information at all hours of the day and night, and you can find practically anything online. It also makes it easy for pupils to complete their assignments. Students can take quizzes and exams more readily, and teachers can hold more productive online classes. It also pushes the classroom's boundaries, encouraging self-paced learning. Learning can be accessed via YouTube and social media. This is more beneficial to students' learning than sitting in lectures and reading textbooks. Learning has become more enjoyable and convenient as a result of technology improvements.</br></br>Technology has an impact on how people communicate, learn, and think. It contributes to society and influences how individuals interact on a daily basis. In today's world, technology plays a critical role. It has both beneficial and negative repercussions on the planet, as well as a direct impact on people's lives. We live in a time when technical advancements are commonplace. Cell phones and the internet are two examples. However, there is a drawback to technical advancements. The impact of technology on learning is one component of technology that has had a significant impact on society. Learning has become more interactive and collaborative, allowing people to better engage with the topics they are learning and having difficulty with.Another area where technology has had an impact on society is communication, or how we converse and connect with one another around the world. Many new forms of electronic communication have emerged as a result of technological advancements. For example, there are emails, social networking, the ability to facetime someone on the other side of the planet, and video conferencing, which allows you to hold virtual meetings. Finally, technical improvements in the health profession have aided in keeping people safe and healthy. There are numerous innovative phone apps that allow consumers to keep track of their weight, calorie intake, heart rate, and other health metrics at any time of day. There's more treatment available, a change in healthcare that includes benefits for the aged, and hospitals that use technology.</br></br>However, research demonstrate that mobile communication has a negative impact on people's ability to be sociable and make face-to-face contact. Mobile technology has the potential to reduce interpersonal interactions and relationships. There is less personal time, and you may find that you do not have enough time for yourself because you are constantly in communication with others. It can also be a source of distraction from your studies. There is also a loss of privacy because anyone, at any moment, can locate you wherever. Finally, all of these factors have an impact on how people behave today. Our way of life would be simpler without technological breakthroughs. Today's human behavior is shaped by technological factors.Innumerable ways have modern technology impacted our lives, transforming how we work, live, and play. In many American homes as late as the 1990s, televisions were the pinnacle of technology. In 1989, only 15% of homes had a personal computer, according to the Census Bureau. By 2011, the percentage had risen to 75%.<span id="id1">...</span><span id="id2"> Due to the spread of emails, video conferencing, smartphones, and laptops, modern offices would be unrecognizable to workers of the past.</br></br>

          <b> 1. Positive Affect: </b></br></br> Technology may be intimidating, particularly for companies that have found success doing things a specific way and are hesitant to change. Technology is likewise progressing at a breakneck pace, and many people are uncomfortable with abrupt change in general. You risk losing ground to your competitors if you don't stay up with new technology. To calm your nerves, remember that technology has always progressed with the goal of improving our lives. Also keep in mind that all technology was once brand new. Those who were willing to try new technology were more likely to benefit. So, as new technology emerges or as existing technologies evolve, have an open mind. Technology has provided us with Smart phones, vehicles, and alot of daily basic needed technologies that has been making our daily life easier.Once upon a time, statistics were exceedingly limited. Companies would only have monthly access to reports, making it impossible for them to make well-informed business decisions. Executives can collect and evaluate data in real time using automated software tools, which can then be displayed and sent out as reports as needed. Because everything is digital, you can provide your team access to dashboards that showcase the most critical information rather than needing to hold meetings where you spend time putting up boards or giving slides with out-of-date data. Essentially, technology has made it easier to collect and analyze large amounts of data to aid in decision-making, as well as to communicate findings across your organization at a rapid pace.

        </br></br><b>2. Negative Affect:</b> </br></br>The negative effects of technology on children's physical health are arguably the easiest to quantify of all the negative effects of technology. Metabolic illnesses due by sedentary lifestyles fostered by technology usage have been the most widely cited health effect of technology use. Sitting with a digital gadget not only reduces the amount of physical activity needed to keep fit, but it also encourages increased snacking, all of which leads to obesity, among other problems. Constant sitting causes back and neck problems, which have now been aggravated by constantly bending into the handheld device, resulting in a new condition known as Text Neck. Tendonitis in the thumb is a condition induced by the repeated use of the thumb to press buttons on devices or by playing too many video games.The use of social media has been demonstrated to be closely linked to depression and anxiety. The link between social networks and depression and anxiety was discovered in a systematic research published in 2016. Children who use technology excessively are more prone to develop mental health problems, such as inattention, low creativity, language delays, social and emotional development delays, and addiction to digital devices. A study of 15â€“16-year-olds indicated that individuals who spent more time on digital media had a higher risk of developing symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</span></span></p></br></br>
